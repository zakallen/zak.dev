I"ƒ<p>Born and raised in Chicago, I actually enjoyed the weather.</p>

<p>I played varsity soccer at Northwestern and studied Computer Science in the
McCormick School of Engineering.</p>

<p>At Northwestern, I worked on <a href="https://dailynorthwestern.com/2015/05/19/campus/barlift-aims-to-improve-students-experiences-at-bars/">BarLift</a> ğŸ¸, did research at <a href="http://delta.northwestern.edu/">Delta Lab</a>
and <a href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu/">DTR</a> ğŸ¥¼, had a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2702613.2726960">paper published</a> ğŸ“,
and was even named <a href="https://nusports.com/news/2015/10/27/MSOC_1027154456.aspx?path=mten">Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week</a> âš½ï¸.</p>

<p>During my senior year I worked part time getting <a href="https://www.flyhomes.com">FlyHomes</a> off the ground.
As I finished my degree, I was able to transition to full-time and build out a 5 person
team based out of India. We sold around 50 homes sold across 3 cities, and built the team to
about 20 before I left. Hereâ€™s a somewhat recent <a href="https://dailynorthwestern.com/2019/11/26/campus/flyhomes-four-years-after-starting-at-kellogg/">article</a> about the early days.</p>

<p>In February 2017 I decided to move to San Francisco and join <a href="https://www.shoguninc.com">Shogun</a> (better known
as <a href="https://www.gethearth.com">Hearth</a> to our customers). Since then weâ€™ve grown the company to over 80 people.</p>

<p>On the side I follow space, advise <a href="https://www.blockrize.com">Blockrize</a>, and have been working on a code-driven
project management app called <a href="https://cosmolabs.io">Cosmo</a>.</p>
