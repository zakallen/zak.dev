Dopamine. Ah, the rush.

The endless possibilities of what this latest project can become. It's not like all the others. It won't end up in the old car graveyard like the rest.

A million dollars. Someone could eventually buy it for that much. Wait, a billion sounds way better. The amount of people that can be managed, mentored, all on this rocket ship. This side thing will help the world, make it a **better place**. This company will be different, we'll even _think different_. Fridays will be off and everyone will be happy.

I wonder where we should put the campus. I like the idea of everyone being remote, but an office in the early days could make the innovation happen faster.

Wait, I need a name. No vowels, .io for sure. Something totally independent of the service we provide. I don't want to be the next 24 hour fitness. Something like Lime, or Uber, or Zoom. It's gotta be one syllable, easy to spell, easy to say. But I need to be able to have a good domain name. Nothing like justuse[name]co.io.

I need to make sure that this project can scale. Am I picking the right language and framework? I've learned by doing, so I can pick a new one. But I've heard that when you're serious, you should stick to something you already know so you can focus on the product. Yes, I'm definitely serious.

Ok, looks like I'll continue tomorrow. Wow, I made a lot of progress. This definitely won't end up like the others.
