Born and raised in Chicago, I actually enjoyed the weather.

I played varsity soccer at Northwestern and studied Computer Science in the
McCormick School of Engineering.

At Northwestern, I worked on [BarLift][barlift], did research at [Delta Lab][delta-lab]
and [DTR][dtr], had a [paper published][gaze],
and was even named [Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week][nusports].

During my senior year I worked part time getting [FlyHomes][flyhomes] off the ground.
As I finished my degree, I was able to transition to full-time and build out a 5 person
engineering team based out of India. We sold around 50 homes sold across 3 cities, and built the team to
about 20 before I left. Here's a somewhat recent [article][flyhomes-daily] about the early days.

In February 2017, I decided to move to San Francisco and join [Hearth][hearth]. Since then we've grown the company to over 180 people with an engineering team size of over 24.

On the side I follow space, advised [Blockrize][blockrize] (acquired by [Gemini][gemini]), and have been working on a
no-code frontend platform called Pickle ðŸ¥’
